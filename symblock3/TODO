 - add slicing
 - matrix diagonals (must allow non-vanishing non-totally-symmetric irrep blocks)
 - broadcasting
 - add O-V blocking -- some kind of "zipped" axis?
      ZipAxis({
        "O": SpinAxis(U, (IrrepAxis(C2v, (3, 0, 1, 1), ndarray), IrrepAxis(C2v, (3, 0, 0, 1), ndarray)), Array),
        "V": SpinAxis(U, (IrrepAxis(C2v, (1, 0, 0, 1), ndarray), IrrepAxis(C2v, (1, 0, 1, 1), ndarray)), Array)
      })
   as long as the axis types match, this would allow you to generalize pretty easily to multiple subspaces
